                <h2>Camera Jacket</h2>
                <p>
                    We make a high quilty camera jacket that is sure to slow you down enough to get them epic photos you have been after whist still looking the part! The wings unclip at the trouser waist so you can get your rig on, it  comes with a stock hidden pocket and obviously the wings what we use poly cotton for, we do normal jackets as well, for now just design and measure a camera jacket and leave the wings with no colour until I design a new jacket.

                <p>
                    Our hybrid suits are a hybrid of tunnel and freefly, although the freefly suits work great in the tunnel these are more designed for it, they are a more slim fit and a better fit for females due to the lycra section on the shoulders, the defult material for the torso is taslan but you do have the option for poly cotton if you are a bit heavier.

                    The freefly 1 suit is your every day freefly suit, its has reinforced courdura knees, shin and bum, we have a lycra strip above the knee and lycra up the inseam to crotch for ultimate flexability in freefly it also includes lycra and a elastic strip on the back, you have the option of poly cotton or taslan for the torso (default material is taslan) taslan provides the most even fall rate for you in freefly/freefall.
